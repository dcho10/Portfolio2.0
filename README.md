## Introduction

Welcome to the portfolio of David Cho!

In my portfolio, you will get to know about me, view the projects that I have worked on, a snippet of my resume, and a contact form where you can reach me!

## About Me

While I cannot give you all the information about me, my name is David Cho and I am a former accounting graduate who began studying software engineering in 2023. 

I decided to give software engineering a try because of the creativity it offers that accounting could not. I am hopeful to use what I learned through out the Coding Bootcamp and apply it in the real world one day.

## Projects and Skills

Throughout the Coding Bootcamp, I have acquired several skills including front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React), and back-end (SQL, NoSQL, Express). Other skills include Node.js, and Express.
